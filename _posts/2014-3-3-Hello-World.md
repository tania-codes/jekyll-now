Dont make me think is a must read if your doing anything in web development and design.
This book is one of my favorite books to refer back to when dealing with clients looking for redesigns or even just help with there website.

I felt like i had a lot of DUH moments while reading this book, but reliaved what I dont do alot of is think more in dept as far as  reasoning on why things work a certain way and why others dont.

- static site
- using Liquid 
- Useing my code editor (because wordpress)
