Before I became a mom/coder I was working in the IT field as a IT tech doing things like server migrations and software updates for big fortune 500 companies in Dallas, Texas.  

As a autodidact I took on code and design as a hobby to support my hiking habit while still at my 9-5. As my small hobby grew so did my family. I ended up leaving my 9-5 as a project tech to be a full-time freelance front-end developer and work from home mom. 

During the day I’m mostly a personal assistant to my TWO year old daughter. We spend most of our mornings at the park or reading books at home. 

I am an avid lover of learning and when I’m not busy with work i’m usually up in a book.
